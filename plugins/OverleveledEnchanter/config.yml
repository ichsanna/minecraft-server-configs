#OverleveledEnchanter config file

#Change this to true if you want to enable merging enchantments to an uncapped level
#If this is set to false Example: If a player combines 2 unbreaking III books they will receive an unbreaking III book
#If this is set to true Example: If a player combines 2 unbreaking III books they will receive an unbreaking IV book
Uncapped-Merge-Combination: true

#This is the most amount of level a merge in the anvil can cost. If the resulting cost is higher than this one, It will be set to this one.
#The maximum valid value for this is 2147483647, DO NOT put a larger number than the maximum valid one!
#The minimum valid value for this is 1!
Max-Level-Cost: 100

#Here you can set the maximum level an enchant can reach.  If an enchanted item has a level above the maximumLevel value and gets into the anvil,
#The resulting item will have it's enchantment's value set to the maximumLevel value.
#Leave the value as -1 to have no limit.  Some enchantments like silk touch and infinity have already their values set to 1, since there is no
#Reason for them to have a higher value than 1.
